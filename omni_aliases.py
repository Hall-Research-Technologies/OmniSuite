"""Friendly device names, owned by OmniSuite and keyed by stable identity.

A teacher's phone should say "Document Camera", not "at-omni-111-04553". That
is a labelling problem, and it is deliberately *only* a labelling problem:

  * Nothing here writes to a device. The OmniStream hostname is untouched, and
    an alias never becomes a device configuration change.
  * Nothing here participates in authorization or routing. Permissions are
    keyed by the normalised hardware identity and stay that way; an alias is a
    string hung off that identity, and renaming one moves no boundary.

The second point is the one worth being careful about. If an alias could ever
be resolved back to a device, two accounts could be given the same alias and
one would reach the other's equipment. So the mapping is one-directional by
construction -- identity to label -- and there is no lookup by name anywhere in
this module. The tests assert that property rather than trusting the comment.

Stored centrally on the host so every browser sees the same names, keyed by
identity so an address change does not lose them, and written with the
atomic-replace-under-one-lock rule the rest of the project uses.

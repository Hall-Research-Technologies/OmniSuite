"""The hardware fence for the automated test suite.

Automated tests must never reach a real device. Until Phase 8B this was
enforced in `run_tests.py`, which meant a plain `python -m unittest`, an IDE
runner or a mutation harness ran the same tests with no protection at all --
the rule held only for as long as every future runner remembered to install it.

The fence now lives with the tests. `tests/__init__.py` installs it, and every
test module installs it too, so it is present however the suite is entered:
through `run_tests.py`, through `python -m unittest`, through discovery, or by
a runner loading a module file directly.

What it covers: WebSocket connections, raw TCP, UDP datagrams, and therefore
everything layered on a socket -- HTTP, thumbnail fetches, and the
`config_get` / `config_set` / `method` transports, which all reach the network
through one of those.

Loopback is deliberately allowed. A Flask test client never opens a socket at
all, but a test that starts a local server and talks to 127.0.0.1 is talking to
itself, not to a device.

Live bench validation is a separate activity that does not import this module.

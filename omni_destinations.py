"""Where a remote caller may make the server connect.

Discovery and device control are different trust boundaries.

    DISCOVERY   probes candidate addresses to find out what is there.
    CONTROL     talks to a device the application already knows, using the
                credential it holds for that device.

The server attaches a device password to nearly every connection it makes. If
the address comes from a remote browser, that browser can choose where the
password goes, so the two rules below are applied to every request that
arrived on the network-facing listener. The local operator is untouched.

    control     every address the request names must be one the server
                already holds in its inventory. An address it has never seen
                is refused, whatever it looks like.
    discovery   an address the server has never seen may be probed only if it
                is a unicast address that is not on the public Internet:
                never loopback, link-local, multicast, unspecified, reserved
                or global. That keeps a stolen session from aiming the
                configured scan credential at a host of its own choosing,
                while still letting a remote administrator scan the site.

Which rule applies is decided by the route; which values the rule examines is
decided by name, across every route, so an endpoint added later that takes an
`ip` is covered without anyone remembering to list it. A test fails when a
handler reads an address-like body key this module does not know.

"""Protecting a secret that has to be readable again later.

Most secrets in OmniSuite are one-way: a password is hashed with scrypt and
nothing ever needs the original back. A Direct Access link is not like that.
The operator has to be able to open Settings a month later and copy the same
link, so the token has to be recoverable -- which means storing it in a form
that survives a restart and is not simply sitting in a JSON file in plain text.

Nothing here invents cryptography. On Windows it is DPAPI, the operating
system's own facility for exactly this: `CryptProtectData` encrypts with a key
derived from the logged-in user's credentials and held by the OS, so the blob is
useless to another account on the machine and useless on another machine. That
is the established platform mechanism, it needs no dependency, and OmniSuite
already runs as the operator's own user.

Where DPAPI is not available the honest answer is that there is no equivalent
facility in the standard library, and this says so rather than pretending:
`protect()` reports which protection was actually applied, the caller records
it, and the operator-facing surface can state it. An obfuscation invented here
would look like protection and be none.

Two rules:

  * `protect` never raises. A secret that cannot be protected is still a secret
    the product has to store, and failing the operation would leave the account
    in a half-configured state. It returns the weaker protection and says so.
  * `unprotect` returns None rather than raising on anything it cannot read --
    a blob from another user, another machine, or a damaged file. The caller
    treats that as "this link cannot be shown; regenerate it", which is true
    and is recoverable.

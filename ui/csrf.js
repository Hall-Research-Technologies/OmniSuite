// The defect this exists for: an administrator signed in from another device
// could read everything and change nothing. Measured against the live remote
// listener -- POST /api/get_thumbnail_status answered 403 "not permitted"
// without the header and 400 "IP address required" with it, which is the
// handler's own answer. Reads were unaffected throughout, so the session was
// fine and nothing on screen said what was wrong.
//
// The cause is ordinary history. The matrix, USB, Multiview and Settings pages
// were written when OmniSuite answered only on the computer it ran on, where
// the gate trusts the socket and never looks for a token. Remote access added
// the requirement; those 57 call sites predate it.
//
// So this is deliberately NOT 57 edits. One wrapper around `fetch` covers every
// existing call site and every one somebody writes later, which is the half of
// the problem that a sweep through the files would not have solved.
//
// It is not a security control. The gate decides; this only makes the browser
// present what the gate asks for, exactly as the sign-in page and the two
// remote pages already did by hand.

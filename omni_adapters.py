"""Network adapters, with an identity that survives an address change.

Remote Access is assigned to an ADAPTER, not to an address. An operator picks
"the bench network", and the machine's address on it is a detail that can
change -- a DHCP lease expires, a cable moves to a different port, somebody
sets a static address. None of that should mean the listener silently stops
coming back.

So every adapter carries a stable identity, and that identity is what gets
persisted. Three things are deliberately NOT identity:

  * The friendly name. On Windows "Ethernet 3" is renameable in Settings, and
    on any platform two machines can use the same word for different hardware.
  * The IP address. It is the thing that changes; using it as identity is the
    defect this module exists to fix. Worse, an address can be reassigned to a
    different adapter entirely -- on the machine this was found on,
    192.168.100.180 belonged to a Wi-Fi adapter and 192.168.100.185 to an
    Ethernet one, same subnet, different hardware.
  * Position in the list. Enumeration order is not stable and never was.

What IS identity, per platform:

  * Windows: the interface GUID. It is the key Windows itself files the
    adapter under in the registry, it survives renaming, re-addressing,
    driver reloads and reboots, and it is what `Get-NetAdapter` reports as
    `InterfaceGuid`. Where that cannot be read, the MAC address is the
    fallback -- stable per card, though a card can be replaced and some
    virtual adapters share one, which is why it is second rather than first.
  * Everything else: the interface name. Unlike the Windows friendly name,
    `eth0` / `en0` IS the operating system's own handle for the interface.

Enumeration is read-only. Nothing here binds, configures or changes anything.

"""Serialising operations that target the same physical equipment.

Two teachers pressing Show on the same display at the same moment is now an
ordinary event rather than a hypothetical one, so the question is what the
second one gets. The answer this branch takes is the one that suits AV
control: **the last successful authorised operation wins.** Nobody reserves a
room, nobody is locked out because a browser was closed, and a display is never
left unusable by an operator who walked away.

What that is *not* is a licence for two requests to interleave inside one
transaction. The device work already has its own verification and rollback, and
those guarantees only hold if one transaction at a time is running against a
given piece of equipment. So an operation takes a short lock on the resources it
touches, does its work, and releases. Concurrency is preserved between rooms;
it is removed only where it would corrupt something.

Three rules, each of which exists because of a failure mode the project has
already met:

  * **Narrow, not global.** One lock per decoder, per USB relationship. Routing
    in Room 101 must not wait on Room 102, or a site becomes single-file.

  * **Deterministic ordering.** An operation touching several resources takes
    them in sorted order, always. Two operations grabbing the same pair in
    opposite orders is the textbook deadlock, and USB routing touches two
    endpoints at once.

  * **Bounded waiting.** A lock is never held across a request boundary and
    never waited on forever. A device that stops answering mid-transaction must
    not take the room's next operation down with it.

The locks protect *operations*, never reads. Observation goes through the state
cache and takes nothing.
